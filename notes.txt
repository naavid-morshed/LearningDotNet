1. In EndPoints, method can return WebApplication obj or RouteGroupBuilder obj.	
2. RouteGroupBuilder? group is used to defined a set of related routes
3. [Required][StringLength(50)] string Name [these are class annotations like springboot]
4. MinimalApis.Extensions in Nuget Packages [add WithParameterValidation() after methods to make sure point (3) 
   is applied during requests]

   Example => group.MapPost("/", (CreateGameDto newGame) =>
        {
            GameDto game = new(
                games.Count + 1,
                newGame.Name,
                newGame.Genre,
                newGame.Price,
                newGame.ReleaseDate
            );

            games.Add(game);

            return Results.CreatedAtRoute(GetGameEndPointName, new { id = game.Id }, game);
        }).WithParameterValidation(); // this is required to make this package work, it can also be added to group at class level
